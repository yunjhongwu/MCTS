# Monte-Carlo Tree Search
Implementations of the algorithms described in Munos, R. (2014). From bandits to Monte-Carlo Tree Search: The optimistic principle applied to optimization and planning. *Foundations and TrendsÂ® in Machine Learning*, 7(1), 1-129.

The algorithms are implemented only for finding the maximum of a function defined on [0, 1].

Algorithms implemented:
  - Section 3: Optimistic optimization with known smoothness
    - Deterministic Optimistic Optimization (DOO)
    - Stochastic Optimistic Optimization (StoOO)
    - Hierarchical Optimistic Optimization (HOO)
  - Section 4: Simultaneous Optimistic Optimization
    - Simultaneous Optimistic Optimization (SOO)
    - Stochastic Simultaneous Optimistic Optimization (StoSOO)

Algorithms to implement:
  - Section 5: Optimistic planning
    - Optimistic Planning algorithm (OPD)
    - Open Loop Optimistic Planning (OLOP)
    - Optimistic planning in MDP (OP-MDP)



Requirements:
  - Python 3.7
  - Numpy 1.14
  - Networkx 2.1
